    # Clusterization
    ### Clusterization - part 1. Creation of the first clusters (composed of 2 devices).
    - Selects 1 device as the reference one (chosen randomly).
    - Then check all other devices that are near this reference device.
    - Orders (by the distance) all near devices to the reference one.
    - Finally, select the closest device to the reference one in order to create a cluster with it.
    - Repeat this process until there is no device available.

    ### Clusterization - part 2. Absorbing the unclustered devices from part 1 by the firstly created clusters.

    ### Clusterization - part 3. Changing the clusterhead from clusters of size 2 in order  to try to create a cluster of size 3.
    - Grabs all the remaining clusters with size 2.
    - Checks if the change of the clusterhead to the other device that was in the same cluster will now make it possible to encapsulate all 3 devices in the same cluster.
    - If this change of the clusterhead can now encapsulate all 3 devices, proceed with the swap, else ignore (main the older clusterhead).

    ### Clusterization - part 4. Merging clusters into bigger ones.
    - The clusterheads communicates with other clusterheads.
    - If the clusterhead communicated is within the reach of the communicating clusterheads, then they may belong to the same cluster, so, all devices from the communicated clusterhead are also checked if they are within the reach of the communicating clusterhead.
    - If the communicated clusterhead and ALL of its members are in the range of the communicating clusterhead, then the whole cluster is absorbed by the communicating clusterhead. 
    - This process is repeated until either there is no more near clusters to be absorbed by the communicating clusterhead or the clusterhead that is absorbing other cluster has reached its maximum devices number.

    ### Clusterization - part 5 - Rebalancing. 
    This step tries to balance the clusters based on the minimum cluster value.
    - First, it classifies the clusters into clusters that can give devices away (and still have the minimum value of devices), and clusters that need more devices to achive the minimum devices number per cluster.
    - Then, the clusters that need more devices analyzes if there is a nearby cluster that can give away devices (based on the 2*Device radius, the same way as in part 5) and "steals" the closest device from the larger cluster.

    ### Clusterization - part 6 - Final step: unclustered devices becomes a single cluster.
    - The unclustered devices becomes a single cluster, where the device itself is the clusterhead.
    - The last step is shuffling the clusters (so that we do not get a sequence of clusters of size 1, for instance)
